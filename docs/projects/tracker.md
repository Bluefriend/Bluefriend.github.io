## Objective
---
Applying C++, OpenCV based object tracking module to mobile devices and optimized it


## How to do
---
### Android
Use OpenCV and NDK for android.
In order to optimize, use GPU and Threads
For CUDA, use Tegra and NVIDIA’s Codeworks for android
Use OpenCL in OpenCV’s T-API and wrote OpenCL kernel codes for converting color

### iOS
iOS uses Objective-C++ language which is based on C++ so there was no need to use other library.
I used C++ library without any interface.
I could not use OpenCL in iOS since iOS does not support OpenCL but thanksfully, it's faster than Android without any optimization.
